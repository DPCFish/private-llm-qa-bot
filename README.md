## Private LLM QA Bot

A private lightweight language model (LLM) based question answering bot. This bot uses a pre-trained LLM model to answer questions provided by users. The bot is designed to run lightweighted model on user infrastructure with comparable performance/accuracy in vertical industry. The bot can be used for general or domain-specific QA needs. It allows users to leverage the power of LLMs for QA tasks without having to upload data or queries to any SaaS like LLM providers.

The bot also utilizes a vector database to improve its accuracy for domain-specific questions. The database stores vector representations of words and entities in a given domain. These representations are used to match user questions to potential answers. The combination of the LLM and vector database allows the bot to achieve higher precision for specialized domains.
