We are constantly working to expand the capacity within our data centers, the physical capacity of our availability zones and regions, and our global geographical coverage (new regions).\\n\\nEC2 Capacity Planning assists in preparing the future capacity needs of external customers, adds them into AWS demand signals through the FOOB process, and then manages the delivery of capacity to the customer account through AWS Assisted CR. TAMs and SAs should proactively work with their customers to understand future capacity needs and engage EC2 Capacity Planning following the below process.\\n\\nDefinitions\\nFOOB: FOOB stands for \"Future Out Of Band\" signal. FOOBs are used to communicate to EC2 that there is an emergent or spiky customer demand event that is not predicted by the past behavior of the customer. The ultimate goal of submitting FOOBs is to reduce the likelihood that customers will find insufficient capacity to support these exceptional events. The EC2 Organic Forecast leverages historical, seasonal and recent trends to recommend run-rate growth of EC2 capacity across customer segments. We recommend submitting a FOOB (Via the MaitreD tool - see below) at least 7-8 weeks in advance of the customer requirement. The most frequent use cases requiring FOOBs include:\\nLaunching a new workload in an existing or a new AZ\\nDemand events outside of the historical demand pattern and seasonality of the business - This includes spikes as well as decreases or \\'scale-downs\\'\\nPlanned changes in the type of EC2 instance type used (e.g migrating from C5 to C6G)\\nMid to large scale migrations (from On Prem to AWS or between regions or Server Types)\\nMaitreD: MaitreD is the user interface for CRS (capacity reservation system) where capacity requirements are submitted to generate a FOOB and subsequently collect, reserve, and transfer specified capacity to a customer account through AWS Assisted CR.\\n\\nMaitreD can be accessed via this link. Note, many teams already have MaitreD access, so please take a look at your team here or try MaitreD first before requesting the access. In case you don\\'t have the access, request it by following the steps on \\'Getting Access\\' section here. See MaitreD user guide here. If you are looking for the MaitreD access to others\\' submission, please ask the requester to add you onto the \\'User Access\\' list of his/her submission.\\n\\nAWS Assisted Capacity Reservation: Capacity requested in MaitreD is delivered directly to customers\\' accounts via AWS-Assisted CR. Customers will be notified through their console and Personal Health Dashboard of upcoming capacity requests made though MaitreD and MUST \\'accept\\' these reservations in either their Console or SKD/CLI before the Need By Date to receive the Capacity Reservation. Once a request is approved by Capacity Planning, the Incremental Requested Quantity will be visible as a tag value for each CR under the ‘aws:ec2capacityreservation:incrementalRequestedQuantity’ system key. For first time delivery with AWS-Assisted CR, please follow the User Guide for setup instructions and customer requirements.\\nAuto-Acceptance for all future, requested ODCRs can be toggled on by region through either the Console or CLI.\\nOnce the AWS-Assisted CR delivers to the customer account on the specified Need By Date/Time, it becomes an active On-Demand Capacity Reservation (ODCR). The size of the ODCR to be delivered will be the sum of the capacity requested in MaitreD. The customer will be billed 24/7 for both used and unused capacity under the ODCR from when it’s delivered on the need by date/time until they cancel the reservation and terminate instances. More details on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html\\nPlease note that the capacity requested in the ticket and submitted in MaitreD should be the incremental quantity needed, not the total capacity footprint the customer wants.\\nAs of 10/4/2021, MaitreD\\' can now deliver Open or Targeted ODCRS (documentation).\\nDedicated Hosts (DH). NOTE!!! Assisted ODCR is not available with this product. On the specified need-by-date and time, the instances will automatically be placed into the customer\\'s account and billing will commence. There will NOT be an acceptance notification sent to the customer\\'s PHD. You will need to acknowledge the understanding of this nuance in the ticket before these are approved as evidence the customer understands the billing implications associated with this product and delivery via MaitreD\\'. Confirmation that the customer acknowledges the size of the Dedicated Host that will be delivered, billing method, and reservation management responsibilities must be attached to the ticket before the capacity reservation process can begin.\\nRunbook\\nFor general compute instances: open a ticket (Commercial Regions or ADC (MVP/GovCloud) Regions) with EC2 CCX and fill in the requested information. Include your customer name in the ticket title of the TT. There should be one ticket submitted per project, but multiple need by dates, family types, account IDs, and AZs can be included in a single request if for the same program/event. Please note:\\nFor High Memory instances (U-Series virtual machine and bare metals), please refer to the sections below: High Memory Virtualized Capacity, High Memory Bare Metal.\\nFor Machine Learning requests (P4D, P4DE, P5, TRN1/N):\\nStep 1: Please request leadership approvals using this template: https://approvals.amazon.com/Template/Details/110748. Details on this step can be found in this wiki: EC2 Capacity Escalation Approvals \\nStep 2: Once approvals are obtained, please create a ticket using this new template: ML FOOB Ticket .\\nBuild your capacity request in MaitreD’ and paste the link to the completed request in the ticket from Step 1 (MaitreD’ User Guide). Include your customer name in the “Notes” block above the main body of the reservation. Add your alias to the “Assignee(s)” block.\\nIf you are having issues with MaitreD’, please cut a ticket (MaitreD\\' Issues) or reach out to the PAO On-call. For more information, see the Maitre D\\' Overview page.\\nAn EC2 CCX customer planner will analyze the supportability and provide the recommendations against your request to help build a supportable plan that has a high fulfillment probability. This supportability update and confirmation are tracked via your capacity request TT.\\nOnce you as proxy of your customer agreed with the supportable plan, your planner may request Sales/Business/Financial approvals per Amazon S&TP by requesting you to obtain Sales L8 approval on the TT. CCX planner will follow up the EC2 Business and EC2 Financial approval after the Sales L8 approval obtained.\\nOnce CCX planner finishes all the approval, the MaitreD’ request will be approved and the capacity plan signal will be added to the EC2 Production Forecast to drive server orders to support your customer\\'s capacity requirements.\\nAdditional Notes:\\nMaitre\\'D can be accessed via this link. Note, many teams already have MaireD access, so please take a look at your team here or try MaitreD first before requesting the acess. In case you don\\'t have the access, request it by following the steps on \\'Getting Access\\' section here. See MaitreD user guide here https://w.amazon.com/index.php/EC2/DemandShaping/MaitreD/UserGuide  If you are looking for the MaitreD access to others\\' submission. Please ask the requester to add you onto the \\'User Access\\' list of his/her submission. Additional MaitreD update is required if you need to change the approved plan (capacity request)\\nPlease raise one TT for one customer, see the TT here.\\nIf your customer has significant EBS requirements along with their EC2 scaling request please follow the EBS specific process here.\\nAWS Infrastructure teams have a 7-8 weeks lead time to land more capacity in the data centers because of the various steps involved (new rack ordering, rack manufacturing, shipping, testing etc.) Please allow EC2 capacity planning enough lead time to process and fulfill your request.\\nIf you are supporting a Global Financial Services Customer under Frank Fallon please make sure to also complete the steps here (https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/FinServSATeam/GFSCCMT/?#HOpening2Fupdatinganewcapacityrequest)\\nTo increase the limit on the desired instance, please cut the TT to (AWS > CS - Billing and Accounts > Limit Increase)\\nCapacity requests for ADC regions (GovCloud, MVP) are planned separately than Commercial regions. Guidance can be found here.\\nIf it\\'s a RI renewal request - Please clarify both the current capacity of the customer and the incremental ask as this request will be processed differently from a standard incremental FOOB request. \\nFor instance platform technical questions or roadmap plans, reach the instance PM directly: PM Ownership\\nTo get the right operation system code (Usage Operation) for MaitreD submissions, check the mapping between product_description and billing_product (https://w.amazon.com/index.php/EC2/DropletMeteringService/BillingProducts.\\nTo get the TAM Training for EC2 capacity and other support around EC2 capacity within TAM Org, cut TT to CCMT ( AWS > EC2 Customer Capacity Management > CCMT >aws-ccmt)\\nTo get more info and processes about EC2 Finance, check here: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS_Finance/AWS_Services_Finance/EC2_Finance/EC2_Capacity_Finance/ \\nGiven one yellow badge contractor team in CN, EC2 capacity broadcast in mandarin addresses the local requests: https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/143892g\\nTo search resources for getting work done in the the ADC MVP spaces for EC2, EBS, ELB, and ECS, check here: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/EC2-MVP/Engagement\\nHigh Memory Virtualized Capacity (u-3tb1.56xlarge through u-24tb1.112xlarge)\\nFor high memory virtualized instance requests, u-3tb1.56xlarge through u-24tb1.112xlarge, please follow the below guidelines to help streamline the planning processes.\\nTo initiate a capacity request, please have L8+ Sales approval ready prior to opening the ticket if your request is  >= 2 instances.\\nPlease open a ticket and complete the needed information using the following template:https://t.corp.amazon.com/create/templates/8a4fd90d-791d-48c2-88ad-bdfcd75d3f49 or use CTI: AWS / EC2 Capacity Planning / EC2 High Memory FOOB Requests and select the template for Virtualized requests. Please note this is the CTI for High Memory planning and it is different from the CTI for other instance types.\\nSubmit the request in MaitreD here: https://ec2-maitre-d-prod-iad.iad.proxy.amazon.com/batchCreate?noTrigger=true. Please include the link to the MaitreD batch on the ticket.\\nPlease note due to the complexity involved in High Memory capacity planning, we do not handle sev2/2.5 for High Memory. It cannot be handled by on-call either.\\nNOTE: Baywatch is not a reliable source of truth for High Memory capacity availability assessments.

We are constantly working to expand the capacity within our data centers, the physical capacity of our availability zones and regions, and our global geographical coverage (new regions).\\n\\nEC2 Capacity Planning assists in preparing the future capacity needs of external customers, adds them into AWS demand signals through the FOOB process, and then manages the delivery of capacity to the customer account through AWS Assisted CR. TAMs and SAs should proactively work with their customers to understand future capacity needs and engage EC2 Capacity Planning following the below process.\\n\\nDefinitions\\nFOOB: FOOB stands for \"Future Out Of Band\" signal. FOOBs are used to communicate to EC2 that there is an emergent or spiky customer demand event that is not predicted by the past behavior of the customer. The ultimate goal of submitting FOOBs is to reduce the likelihood that customers will find insufficient capacity to support these exceptional events. The EC2 Organic Forecast leverages historical, seasonal and recent trends to recommend run-rate growth of EC2 capacity across customer segments. We recommend submitting a FOOB (Via the MaitreD tool - see below) at least 7-8 weeks in advance of the customer requirement. The most frequent use cases requiring FOOBs include:\\nLaunching a new workload in an existing or a new AZ\\nDemand events outside of the historical demand pattern and seasonality of the business - This includes spikes as well as decreases or \\'scale-downs\\'\\nPlanned changes in the type of EC2 instance type used (e.g migrating from C5 to C6G)\\nMid to large scale migrations (from On Prem to AWS or between regions or Server Types)\\nMaitreD: MaitreD is the user interface for CRS (capacity reservation system) where capacity requirements are submitted to generate a FOOB and subsequently collect, reserve, and transfer specified capacity to a customer account through AWS Assisted CR.\\n\\nMaitreD can be accessed via this link. Note, many teams already have MaitreD access, so please take a look at your team here or try MaitreD first before requesting the access. In case you don\\'t have the access, request it by following the steps on \\'Getting Access\\' section here. See MaitreD user guide here. If you are looking for the MaitreD access to others\\' submission, please ask the requester to add you onto the \\'User Access\\' list of his/her submission.\\n\\nAWS Assisted Capacity Reservation: Capacity requested in MaitreD is delivered directly to customers\\' accounts via AWS-Assisted CR. Customers will be notified through their console and Personal Health Dashboard of upcoming capacity requests made though MaitreD and MUST \\'accept\\' these reservations in either their Console or SKD/CLI before the Need By Date to receive the Capacity Reservation. Once a request is approved by Capacity Planning, the Incremental Requested Quantity will be visible as a tag value for each CR under the ‘aws:ec2capacityreservation:incrementalRequestedQuantity’ system key. For first time delivery with AWS-Assisted CR, please follow the User Guide for setup instructions and customer requirements.\\nAuto-Acceptance for all future, requested ODCRs can be toggled on by region through either the Console or CLI.\\nOnce the AWS-Assisted CR delivers to the customer account on the specified Need By Date/Time, it becomes an active On-Demand Capacity Reservation (ODCR). The size of the ODCR to be delivered will be the sum of the capacity requested in MaitreD. The customer will be billed 24/7 for both used and unused capacity under the ODCR from when it’s delivered on the need by date/time until they cancel the reservation and terminate instances. More details on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html\\nPlease note that the capacity requested in the ticket and submitted in MaitreD should be the incremental quantity needed, not the total capacity footprint the customer wants.\\nAs of 10/4/2021, MaitreD\\' can now deliver Open or Targeted ODCRS (documentation).\\nDedicated Hosts (DH). NOTE!!! Assisted ODCR is not available with this product. On the specified need-by-date and time, the instances will automatically be placed into the customer\\'s account and billing will commence. There will NOT be an acceptance notification sent to the customer\\'s PHD. You will need to acknowledge the understanding of this nuance in the ticket before these are approved as evidence the customer understands the billing implications associated with this product and delivery via MaitreD\\'. Confirmation that the customer acknowledges the size of the Dedicated Host that will be delivered, billing method, and reservation management responsibilities must be attached to the ticket before the capacity reservation process can begin.\\nRunbook\\nFor general compute instances: open a ticket (Commercial Regions or ADC (MVP/GovCloud) Regions) with EC2 CCX and fill in the requested information. Include your customer name in the ticket title of the TT. There should be one ticket submitted per project, but multiple need by dates, family types, account IDs, and AZs can be included in a single request if for the same program/event. Please note:\\nFor High Memory instances (U-Series virtual machine and bare metals), please refer to the sections below: High Memory Virtualized Capacity, High Memory Bare Metal.\\nFor Machine Learning requests (P4D, P4DE, P5, TRN1/N):\\nStep 1: Please request leadership approvals using this template: https://approvals.amazon.com/Template/Details/110748. Details on this step can be found in this wiki: EC2 Capacity Escalation Approvals \\nStep 2: Once approvals are obtained, please create a ticket using this new template: ML FOOB Ticket .\\nBuild your capacity request in MaitreD’ and paste the link to the completed request in the ticket from Step 1 (MaitreD’ User Guide). Include your customer name in the “Notes” block above the main body of the reservation. Add your alias to the “Assignee(s)” block.\\nIf you are having issues with MaitreD’, please cut a ticket (MaitreD\\' Issues) or reach out to the PAO On-call. For more information, see the Maitre D\\' Overview page.\\nAn EC2 CCX customer planner will analyze the supportability and provide the recommendations against your request to help build a supportable plan that has a high fulfillment probability. This supportability update and confirmation are tracked via your capacity request TT.\\nOnce you as proxy of your customer agreed with the supportable plan, your planner may request Sales/Business/Financial approvals per Amazon S&TP by requesting you to obtain Sales L8 approval on the TT. CCX planner will follow up the EC2 Business and EC2 Financial approval after the Sales L8 approval obtained.\\nOnce CCX planner finishes all the approval, the MaitreD’ request will be approved and the capacity plan signal will be added to the EC2 Production Forecast to drive server orders to support your customer\\'s capacity requirements.\\nAdditional Notes:\\nMaitre\\'D can be accessed via this link. Note, many teams already have MaireD access, so please take a look at your team here or try MaitreD first before requesting the acess. In case you don\\'t have the access, request it by following the steps on \\'Getting Access\\' section here. See MaitreD user guide here https://w.amazon.com/index.php/EC2/DemandShaping/MaitreD/UserGuide  If you are looking for the MaitreD access to others\\' submission. Please ask the requester to add you onto the \\'User Access\\' list of his/her submission. Additional MaitreD update is required if you need to change the approved plan (capacity request)\\nPlease raise one TT for one customer, see the TT here.\\nIf your customer has significant EBS requirements along with their EC2 scaling request please follow the EBS specific process here.\\nAWS Infrastructure teams have a 7-8 weeks lead time to land more capacity in the data centers because of the various steps involved (new rack ordering, rack manufacturing, shipping, testing etc.) Please allow EC2 capacity planning enough lead time to process and fulfill your request.\\nIf you are supporting a Global Financial Services Customer under Frank Fallon please make sure to also complete the steps here (https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/FinServSATeam/GFSCCMT/?#HOpening2Fupdatinganewcapacityrequest)\\nTo increase the limit on the desired instance, please cut the TT to (AWS > CS - Billing and Accounts > Limit Increase)\\nCapacity requests for ADC regions (GovCloud, MVP) are planned separately than Commercial regions. Guidance can be found here.\\nIf it\\'s a RI renewal request - Please clarify both the current capacity of the customer and the incremental ask as this request will be processed differently from a standard incremental FOOB request. \\nFor instance platform technical questions or roadmap plans, reach the instance PM directly: PM Ownership\\nTo get the right operation system code (Usage Operation) for MaitreD submissions, check the mapping between product_description and billing_product (https://w.amazon.com/index.php/EC2/DropletMeteringService/BillingProducts.\\nTo get the TAM Training for EC2 capacity and other support around EC2 capacity within TAM Org, cut TT to CCMT ( AWS > EC2 Customer Capacity Management > CCMT >aws-ccmt)\\nTo get more info and processes about EC2 Finance, check here: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS_Finance/AWS_Services_Finance/EC2_Finance/EC2_Capacity_Finance/ \\nGiven one yellow badge contractor team in CN, EC2 capacity broadcast in mandarin addresses the local requests: https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/143892g\\nTo search resources for getting work done in the the ADC MVP spaces for EC2, EBS, ELB, and ECS, check here: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/EC2-MVP/Engagement\\nHigh Memory Virtualized Capacity (u-3tb1.56xlarge through u-24tb1.112xlarge)\\nFor high memory virtualized instance requests, u-3tb1.56xlarge through u-24tb1.112xlarge, please follow the below guidelines to help streamline the planning processes.\\nTo initiate a capacity request, please have L8+ Sales approval ready prior to opening the ticket if your request is  >= 2 instances.\\nPlease open a ticket and complete the needed information using the following template:https://t.corp.amazon.com/create/templates/8a4fd90d-791d-48c2-88ad-bdfcd75d3f49 or use CTI: AWS / EC2 Capacity Planning / EC2 High Memory FOOB Requests and select the template for Virtualized requests.

Used for if reservation has just been made\\nON_TRACK When the reservation is allocating just right/当前预留正好合适\\nAHEAD_OF_SCHEDULE When there is a surplus in what the current allocation holds/当前分配有盈余时\\nBEHIND_OF_SCHEDULE When there is a deficit in allocation/当分配不够\\n1.3 P4/P5 Instance 附加流程\\n1. https://approvals.amazon.com/Template/Details/110748 根据这个模板填写您负责的用户的相关信息，并且清楚的描述用户的相关需求\\n2. 在上述链接中贴上的你的FOOB Ticket Link 和 MaitreD Ticket Link\\n3. 提交请求，然后等待各级负责人人员审批\\n1.4 其他常用链接：\\n完整培训视频：https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/564991\\nBaywatch查看当前capacity:https://ec2-baywatch-prod-iad.iad.proxy.amazon.com/pages/poolViewer\\nUrgent 需求查看oncall: https://oncall.corp.amazon.com/#/view/ec2-capacity-delegates/schedule?aliases=\\nRunbook Wiki：https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/EC2_Capacity_Planning_-_External_Capacity_Runbook/\\nHM virts runbook https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/EC2_Capacity_Planning_-_External_Capacity_Runbook/#HHighMemoryVirtualizedCapacity28[…]xlargethroughu-12tb1.112xlarge29\\nHM bare metal runbook: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/EC2_Capacity_Planning_-_External_Capacity_Runbook/#HHighMemoryCapacity28u-6tb1.metalthroughu-24tb1.metal2\\nTags: [+]\\nComments (1)\\nAttachments (14)\\nHistory\\nInformation\\nViewed:\\n605 times\\n  Backlinks:\\nNo backlinks\\n  Pages that transclude this page:\\nNo pages transclude this page\\n  MVP Replication Status:\\nDisabled\\nMore information about MVP replication can be found here.\\n \"]}]"

      "MaitrieD 填写Tips ，注意必须严格按系统要求的格式来填写，否则会提交失败，如Region，AZ，NBD等，千万注意机型别申请错了：https://www.figma.com/proto/KIW7T0o3WyHBV0psCS7RDq/MaitreD-Instruction?node-id=7%3A49&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1\n",
      " ！！提醒：Instance Eligibility 选项填写\n",
      "“open”，会动态的把NBD之前的已经在run的按需实例数量例如z，跟MatrieD里填写的数量x，累加到一起，然后按（z+x）台算ODCR。\n",
      "“taget”，只交付MatrieD里填写的数量x，则只把x台算成ODCR。但是客户启动资源时，需要填入预留ID才能跟ODCR的资源匹配上。\n",

      "        ！！注意事项！！：\n",
      "如果申请超过 $500K 或者 3 racks,则需要Sales L8 Director 或者 local business L8 Director的approval（在Ticket中附上approval邮件截图即可）。\n",
      "即使FOOB申请被capacity team approved了，仍然有一定的风险会延迟交付 “While Capacity Planning does its best to use forecasts and levers to deliver on requests, we cannot make any 'guarantees' on delivering capacity on a future date.”\n",
      "请保持关注提交的Ticket，并及时响应处理人员提出的question。\n",

      "Capacity预留confirm之后，请提醒客户在Need By Date之前在后台接受，否则资源会被回收。并在Ticket中回复客户是否接受，Close the Loop。\n",
      "1.2 常见问题\n",
      "1）ODCR预留实例怎么计费？\n",
      "只要交付到客户账户里，无论是否预留实例是否运行，都按等同的按需费率计费。如果客户没有使用预留，将在客户的EC2 账单中显示为未使用的预留。如果客户运行的实例属性与预留匹配，则客户只需要为该实例付费，不需要为预留付费。\n",
      "2）ODCR交付的实例怎么享受RI/Savings Plan计费折扣？\n",
      "Savings Plans 和区域RI实例的账单折扣适用于ODCR。AWS 自动将这些折扣应用于具有匹配属性的容量预留, 客户只要购买与ODCR 实例相同的Regional RI 或者Savings Plan，就能享受到对应的计费折扣。查看更多\n",
      "3）需求需要更改怎么办？\n",
      "在客户Accpet之前，请及时在Ticket里面提出更改需求。\n",
      "4）怎么看现有的Capacity？\n",
      "使用https://ec2-baywatch-prod-iad.iad.proxy.amazon.com/pages/poolViewer\n",
      "Tips：通常情况下使用默认值搜索即可\n",
      "5）怎么看FOOB 审批状态？\n",
      "打开申请的matried链接，看status字段，如果仍然是Pending Approval，则说明FOOB后台还没有批复，如果是Approve，应该是running等其他状态。\n",
      "6）怎么看资源分配是否有risk？\n",
      "FOOB的机制并不能百分百保证资源到位，如果池子剩余资源较少的情况下，可能会延迟交付或者部分交付，可以在Matried中查看allocation status这个字段。这个字段不是默认展示，第一次开启时需要点击做上的设置按钮，打开这个字段。\n",
      "AllocationStatus（每15分钟更新一次） Description\n",
      "NOT_ALLOCATING (previous unknown) status. Used for if reservation has just been made\n",
      "ON_TRACK When the reservation is allocating just right/当前预留正好合适\n",
      "AHEAD_OF_SCHEDULE When there is a surplus in what the current allocation holds/当前分配有盈余时\n",
      "BEHIND_OF_SCHEDULE When there is a deficit in allocation/当分配不够\n",
